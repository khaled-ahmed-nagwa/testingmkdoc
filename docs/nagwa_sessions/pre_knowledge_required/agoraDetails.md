# Agora 

## Signaling Overview
A message is broadcast to all users in the same channel when a user sends a message. The message structure is as follows: {n: user full name, m: user message}, The n field represents the full name of the user who sent the message, while the m field contains the actual message content.
To manage the messages and actions, we have two channels 

1. Messages Channel: Used for transferring chat messages, its name should be `ChatChannel:${currentSessionCredential.sessionId}`.
2. Actions Channel: Used for transferring actions, its name should be `ActionsChannel:${currentSessionCredential.sessionId}`.

## Agora Voice Call (RTC)
To provide the educator with real-time voice communication with the students, we first set the user-needed credentials, We pass the current session credential and the user ID of the active user to the `setSessionCredential` method of the `voiceCallCubit`. This allows the voice call feature to authenticate the user and establish a connection for the session.

By default, when an educator joins a session, permission is requested from him to allow microphone access. Once permission is granted,  his microphone becomes open and he has the flexablilty to turn it off /on.
