# Authntication Process

Authentication is a crucial aspect of our system, providing educators with secure and streamlined access to the Nagwa Sessions app. Here's an overview of the process:

* Account Registration: The registration process is done through our portal. When a new educator signs a contract with Nagwa, the team will create an account for him and provide him with a login email.
* Initial Login: Educators can log in to the app for the first time. using their registered email that was provided by the portal administrator.
* Upon initial login, educators are prompted to set a new password, replacing the initial one. This new password becomes the account password.
- For the next login, educators simply enter their email and account password, after that, they will be routed to the session listing page.

This authentication process ensures the security of educator accounts while offering a user-friendly experience, allowing educators to access the app effortlessly.
